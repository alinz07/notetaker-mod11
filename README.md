## **What Problem does this solve and how was a solution accomplished?**
A notetake app can help organize thoughts and keep track of tasks that one needs to do. Using a server and site hosted on heroku saves money by taking advantage of their free service and saves memory from not just storing locally.
<br/>

## **Things I learned**
* When serving static files, if the server.js or public directory are not in the root directory of the project (in this app they are in the Develop dir), you have to be more specific when passing the root argument for the express.static() method.
